# Diagnosis Of Heart Diseases Using Echocardiography Video Data

Jupyter Notebook, describing the data preprocessing used for the 
fourth project of the "Advanced Machine Learning" course from ETH.

## Non-negative matrix factorization

Non-negative matrix factorization was used to obtain 'eigen-images' of the videos.
All the frames of the new generated videos are a linear combination of that "eigen-images"
which in fact correspond to the end-systole and end-diastole of a cardiac cycle.
